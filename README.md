# DigitalQueue

Project developed by Daniel Vela, Sergio Ruiz and Wilson Melo for the course of Software Architecture of the Colombian School of Engineering for the 2019-II semester.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to implement a digital turn system that is ready to configure and use in any kind of organization. This project should ease customer attention, remove/reduce dead time periods between clients, give full statistic reports in indicators of performance, customer satisfaction and possible bottlenecks or problematic areas, etc, all through a fully customizable, ready to use platform that can be easily adapted to any kind of business model.

Usually, other solutions are focused in a particular business model, allowing little to no customization and thus reducing the number of potential clients. Additionally, these turns are based on *first come-first serve* model in which turns cannot be modified due to any possible circumstance (such as a client leaving the business before the correspondent attention is given), this causes dead time periods in which a service representative cannot attend anybody and clients lose their patience and leave, giving room for more similar incidents.  The final aggregate value is based in the reports feature: a business can get immediate feedback in terms of performance, customer satisfaction and possible bottlenecks or problematic areas.
